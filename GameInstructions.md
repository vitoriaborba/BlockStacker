# BlockStacker-IronHackProject
The point of this game is to stack as many blocks on top of one another as possible.
When you click on the screen, the bouncing box starts to fall. Unless you click (or press Space-Bar) in the exact moment when the two blocks are ideally aligned, 
the part of the block that is sticking out falls off the screen and the next box has less room for landing.
To make things even harder, each box bounces faster than the previous one.
